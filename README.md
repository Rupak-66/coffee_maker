This is created as a Flutter Web project, so you can play around with the design and help me find bugs.

## Packages:

- provider: ^4.3.2 (State Management)
- flutter_xlider: ^3.4.0

## Further Optimizations:

You can create coffee cup by using [Rive](https://rive.app/) which is more flexible. But I chose to go manual just for fun.

You can support me by buying me a coffee.
